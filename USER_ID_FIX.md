# User ID Selection Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing an issue where it always used the first user from the API response (Hosana, ID 1) instead of the currently logged-in user (Ramon, ID 2) when saving medication doses.

## Root Cause

In the `obterDadosUsuario` function in `cardCadastrar.tsx`, the application was always selecting the first user from the array returned by the API (`userData[0]`), regardless of who was actually logged in. This meant that even if a different user was logged in, the app would always use Hosana's ID (1) when saving medication doses.

## Solution

The `obterDadosUsuario` function has been modified to:

1. First check if the logged-in user has an ID and try to find a matching user in the API response
2. If no match is found by ID, try to match by email
3. Only as a last resort fall back to using the first user in the array (previous behavior)

### Code Changes

```typescript
// BEFORE: Always selecting the first user without checking
if (Array.isArray(userData) && userData.length > 0) {
  return userData[0];
}

// AFTER: Trying to find the specific logged-in user
if (Array.isArray(userData) && userData.length > 0) {
  // If we have a logged-in user ID, find the matching user
  if (loggedInUserId) {
    const userFound = userData.find(u => u.id === loggedInUserId);
    if (userFound) {
      return userFound;
    }
  }
  
  // If no match by ID, try by email
  if (user?.email) {
    const userByEmail = userData.find(u => u.email === user.email);
    if (userByEmail) {
      return userByEmail;
    }
  }
  
  // Fallback to first user only if no specific match is found
  return userData[0];
}
```

## Debugging Improvements

Additional debugging information has been added to help diagnose user identification issues in the future:

1. Detailed logging of the user search process
2. Display of the current user context when saving doses
3. Verification of authentication token presence

## Testing

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Log in as a user other than Hosana (e.g., Ramon with ID 2)
2. Try to create and save medication doses
3. Check the console logs to confirm the correct user ID is being used
4. Verify in the database that the doses are associated with the correct user ID

## Expected Result

Now when Ramon (ID 2) logs in and saves medication doses, the doses will be associated with Ramon's ID (2) instead of always using Hosana's ID (1).
