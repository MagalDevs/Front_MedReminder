# MedReminder Dose Saving Error - Problem and Solution

## The Problem
The medication reminder app successfully creates medication records but fails to save the medication doses due to a 400 Bad Request error.

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the code and error logs, we identified the following issues:

1. **Incorrect Request Format**: The `dadosDoses` object contained an unexpected `usuarioId` property that was not required by the API.

2. **Data Type Mismatch**: The `remedioId` needed to be explicitly converted to a number (rather than a string) for the API to accept it.

3. **TypeScript Errors**: There were undefined variable errors in the `limparFormulario` function.

## The Solution

1. **Fix the `dadosDoses` Object Format**:
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const dadosDoses = {
     usuarioId: usuarioId, // This property caused the 400 error
     remedioId: typeof remedioId === 'string' ? Number(remedioId) : remedioId,
     doses: dosesISO
   };

   // After:
   const remedioIdNumber = typeof remedioId === 'string' ? parseInt(remedioId) : remedioId;
   
   const dadosDoses = {
     remedioId: remedioIdNumber,
     doses: dosesISO.map(dose => dose.trim())
   };
   ```

2. **Improve Error Handling**:
   Added more detailed error logging to diagnose issues with the API call.

3. **Fix TypeScript Errors**:
   Added type checking to the state setter functions to prevent undefined variable errors.

## Validation
The changes have been tested and confirmed to fix the 400 Bad Request error. Both medications and their doses are now saved correctly.

## Additional Improvements
- Added sorting of doses chronologically for better consistency
- Enhanced error messages to provide more context when failures occur
- Improved data validation before sending to the API

This solution ensures that the medication doses are saved correctly without the 400 Bad Request error.
