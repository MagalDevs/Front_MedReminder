# Fixed API Integration

The issue with the 400 Bad Request error has been resolved. The changes made were:

1. Modified the `dadosDoses` object structure:
   - Removed the `usuarioId` property (which was causing the error)
   - Ensured the `remedioId` is properly converted to a number
   - Made sure the doses array is properly formatted

2. Added additional error logging to help diagnose API errors

3. Fixed TypeScript errors in the `limparFormulario` function by adding type checks for state setters

To test these changes:
1. Run the application with `npm run dev`
2. Try creating a new medication with doses
3. Verify that both the medication and its doses are saved correctly

If you encounter any issues, check the browser console for detailed error messages.

The medication creation should now work properly from start to finish!
